So far, the following codeline is able to work with data file formats from UCSC Genome Browser, commonly used to describe genomic features like location and chromosome structures. I have adapted it from materials provided in the MITbiox online program Quantitative Biology Workshop from MIT. I am grateful for the educational resources.

This code allows you to create genomic libraries, create histograms to visualize sequence repetitions and infer non-coding sequences such as TATA boxes.
