To access any needed information such as the chromosome and position of 
the gene on the chromosome, just use brackets like this:
'''
gene_inf['uc009auw.1']['chr']

#%% Evaluating the Data
chroms=[] # First we have to create a list

for k in gene_inf.keys(): # For each gene, we look to see if the chromosome is in list.  If not, add it:
  chr=gene_inf[k]['chr']
  if chr not in chroms:
    chroms=chroms+[chr]

#%% Counting Genes
gene_counts={} # this codeline creates a dictionary to store the relevant gene information:
for chr in chroms: # Now this new dictionary must be filled using two for loops: one for each  chromosome and one for each gene:
  chrom_count=0 
  for k in gene_inf.keys():
    if gene_inf[k]['chr']==chr:
      chrom_count+=1

You can peek into the entire chromosomal sequence where we know Cntn4 to reside:
'''
hchr=gene_inf[cntn4]['chr']
hst=gene_inf[cntn4]['start']
hen=gene_inf[cntn4]['end']

cntn4_seq[5:200] # Each sequence is a string of characters now, you can identify specific parts of that gene.  
#%% We can identify where translation begins in the gene sequence using the index command, built into the Python string library:

cntn4_seq.index('ATG')

Here I create data structures. So far it works properly with python 3.12.7
Using the gene_inf dictionary, find out the length of every gene on the four chromosomes collected.

plt.hist(gene_lengths.values(), bins=50, log=True, facecolor='green')

#%% basic mathematic operations with genes.
"""
To compare lengths of genes we can call out a gene by its identifier in the dictionary and add or substract it from 
another gene sequence such as cntn4.
"""
gene_lengths["uc012enb.1"]-len(cntn4_seq)

#%% Beyond the Coding Region
"""
Let’s use the gene_inf data structure to count the base pairs in genes compared to those that aren’t in coding regions.
By using a set data structure, which stores unique items, you can remove duplicates. To make sure there are no double countings, let’s track the indices, of chromosome x so as not to add in a position in the list of coding regions if they’re already considered in another gene this way.

This dictionary contains the starting positions of every gene in the chromosome.
By default, the TATA binding motif relevant to transcriptions is located in a small window of the starting sites.
Let's give it a try with a 40 base pair window upstream.
Now with this dictionary, we can identify which genes contain a TATA binding motif near the starting site, which means
these genes can be regulated with a TATA binding protein.
